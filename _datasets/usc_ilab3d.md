excerpt: 'We collected and created a dataset consisting of RGB, depth panaromic images and Velodyne pointcloud scans, all of these with GPS tags. The data was collected using the stereo-velodyne rig on top of Beobotv3. This dataset is collected primarily for Reinforcement learning environment (BeoGym), that is used to evaluate high-level navigation for agents, although it could be used for other purposes like scene analysis and 3D reconstruction.'
