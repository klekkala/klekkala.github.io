excerpt: 'Dataset consisting of RGB, Depth panaromic images and Velodyne pointcloud scans, all associated with GPS tags. The dataset was collected using the stereo-velodyne rig on top of [Beobotv3](https://klekkala.github.io/hardware/). This dataset is primarily used for [BeoGym](https://klekkala.github.io/software/beogym), that is used to evaluate high-level navigation for agents, although it could be used for other purposes like scene analysis and 3D reconstruction.'
