excerpt: 'To evaluate our model, we propose the Multi Meta Tasks dataset (MMT), a dataset of datasets with 4 high-level tasks: Scene classification, depth-estimation, surface-normal estimation and vanishing point estimation. Scene classification is a meta-supervised problem solved using task-adaptation (different output labels for each subtask), whereas the other tasks are domain adaptation problems. Unlike many other multi-task evaluation benchmarks, for each high-level task, train and test datasets are different'
