excerpt: 'We propose a navigation system consisting of a novel multi-sensor fusion method for calculating precise and accurate aerial coordinates and orientation, of a quadcopter in indoor and GPS-silent environments. This system comprises of a SLAM system that uses Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) features, also known as ORB-SLAM and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).
