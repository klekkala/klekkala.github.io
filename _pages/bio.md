Kiran Lekkala is a PhD candidate at the University of Southern California working with Dr Laurent Itti, in the intersection of Robotics, Computer Vision and Machine learning. Currently, he is working on his thesis on Transferrable pretrained models for Visual Navigation.

Apart from his research, he loves solving math and algorithmic problems, which must have stemmed from his past life when he was into competitive programming. Outside of his time with computers, robots and books, Kiran is into weight training and likes to play his violin.
