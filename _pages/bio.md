Kiran recently finished his PhD from the University of Southern California working with Dr Laurent Itti, at the intersection of Machine learning, Computer Vision and Robotics. His PhD. thesis is on learning transferrable pretrained models for Visual Navigation from unlabeled datasets.

Apart from his research, he loves solving math and algorithmic problems, which must have stemmed from his past life when he was into competitive programming. Outside of his time with computers, robots and books, Kiran is into weight training and likes to play his violin.
