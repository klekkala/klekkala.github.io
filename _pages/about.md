I am a 4th year Computer Science PhD candidate in [ILab](https://ilab.usc.edu/) at the University of Southern California working with Prof. [Laurent Itti](http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/). You can find my [Resume](files/kiran_resume.pdf) and my [Cover Letter](files/cover_letter.pdf)

For my thesis, I work on Knowledge transfer and sharing between models in Robot Control and Perception for mobile navigation and manipulation.

I focus on two areas: Developing methods that can understand a scene from an image/video using a compact representation.

These representations could be used to learn different downstream tasks using experiences from simulators or data collected by real-world robots. 

Second, tackling challenges that occur when this trained model is deployed on a real-world robot using novel adaptation techniques like Meta-learning. 

I am also interested in distributed computing and try to utilize parallelized methods in the above training procedures.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on Autonomous Visual Navigation for Quadcopter as part of my Hons. Project. I was responsible for building the hardware platform and implementing state-estimation modules, primarily visual-inertial SLAM methods.


I'm also a full-stack roboticicst and spend rest of my time building and deploying open sourced learning algorithms to hardware platforms.We recently built a large-scale mobile-robot for our experiments. Please visit the Beobotv3 project for more details. Recently, we also started BeoSim, which is a [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) based simulator for large-scale mobile-manipulation tasks using a simulated version of Beobot. Checkout the [BeoSim](http://gazebosim.org/) project.
