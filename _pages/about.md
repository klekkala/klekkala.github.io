I am a 4th year Computer Science PhD candidate in [ILab](https://ilab.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu) working with Prof. [Laurent Itti](http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/). You can find my [Resume](files/kiran_cv.pdf), [Research](https://klekkala.github.io/research/) and [Bio](https://klekkala.github.io/bio/).

For my thesis, I work on Knowledge transfer and sharing between agent models in mobile navigation and manipulation. I am also interested in distributed computing and try to utilize parallelized methods in the above training procedures.


During my undergraduate studies, I worked on Autonomous Visual Navigation for Quadcopter as part of my Hons. Project. I was responsible for building the hardware platform and implementing state-estimation modules, primarily visual-inertial SLAM methods.


I'm also a full-stack roboticicst and spend rest of my time building and deploying open sourced learning algorithms to hardware platforms. We recently built a large-scale mobile-robot for our experiments. Please visit the [Beobotv3](https://klekkala.github.io/hardware/) project for more details.


I borrowed this website from this amazing [repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
