I am a PhD student in [ILab](https://ilab.usc.edu/) at the University of Southern California where I work with Professor [Laurent Itti](http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/). I primarily work on developing adaptive learning methods for Perception and Control. You can find my [Resume](http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/) and my [Cover Letter](http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/)

I'm also a full-stack roboticicst and spend rest of my time building and deploying learning algorithms to hardware platforms. We are building a large-scale mobile-manipulator for our experiments. Please visit the Beobotv3 project for more details.

Recently, we also started BeoSim, which is a [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) based simulator for large-scale mobile-manipulation tasks using a simulated version of Beobot. Checkout the [BeoSim](http://gazebosim.org/) project.



I borrowed this website from this amazing [repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
