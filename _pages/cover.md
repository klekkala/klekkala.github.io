I focus on two areas: Developing methods that can understand a scene from an image/video using a compact representation.

These representations could be used to learn different downstream tasks using experiences from simulators or data collected by real-world robots. 

Second, tackling challenges that occur when this trained model is deployed on a real-world robot using novel adaptation techniques like Meta-learning.
