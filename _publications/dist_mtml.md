excerpt: 'Usually multi-task learning is done on a single machine/GPU, especially due to the networks having smaller footprints. We develop a novel distributed framework for large-scale multi-task learning where each task can be a single-task or a meta-task and could be trained end-to-end synchronously or asynchronously.'
