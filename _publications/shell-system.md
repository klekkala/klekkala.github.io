excerpt: 'We propose a new Shared Knowledge Lifelong Learning (SKILL) learning paradigm, which deploys a population of LL agents that each learn different tasks independently and in parallel. After learning their respective tasks, agents share and consolidate their knowledge over a communication network, so that, in the end, all agents can master all tasks.'
