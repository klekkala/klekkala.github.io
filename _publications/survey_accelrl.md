In the context of lifelong learningReinforcement Learning (RL) is known for low sample efficiency. RL can be accelerated by learning and transmitting these primitive behaviours and skills. 


This would enable a new agent to learn any new task quickly without the need of learning it from scratch. 

These skills and primitives could be learnt from the demonstrations. Unlike other forms knowledge like demonstrations, learning a high level controller to select a specific low level primitives would be a more efficient option. 

This survey deals with the recent and past advances in learning and using these skills to accelerate RL.




We systematically review and present a survey on methods that can
