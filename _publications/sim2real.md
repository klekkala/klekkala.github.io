excerpt: 'The objective of this paper is to solve a point-goal task in visual navigation using a set of learnable primitives learnt from demonstrations in the simulator and extract primitives from that dataset. The primitives are then used to automatically label FPV and BEV observations, from the simulator along with real-world observations, which the entire model is trained. The goal is to predict which primitive to apply when the agent looks at a picture in the real-world, so that the agent can execute a set of actions to reach a given destination coordinate.'
