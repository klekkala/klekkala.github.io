excerpt: 'Current approaches, like the the streetlearn environment uses Google street view imagery which follows a easy pattern of having 4 way intersections. We propose a dataset and a simulator which can be used by. The dataset is USC ILab 3D dataset which can also be used for 3D reconstructions. Beogym is the simulator and is used for Reinforcement learning and planning. Although our dataset spans over a smaller range compared to google streetview, we focus on more complex set of intersection and more intersection. We also benchmark the current RL and planning algorithms on the USC ILab 3D dataset.'
