excerpt: 'We learn Motor skills (set of primitive behaviours that can be applied for the downstream low-level navigation) from trajectories in the CARLA simulator and transfer them to real-world low-level navigation. We then use two High-level navigation models FPV (First person view) model, BEV (Birds eye view) model to pick the right primitive, given a real-world observation.'
