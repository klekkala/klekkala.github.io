excerpt: 'We try to better exploration in Blackbox methods, particularly Evolution strategies (ES), when applied to Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems where intermediate waypoints/subgoals are available. We use the state-action pairs from the trajectories obtained during rollouts/evaluations, to learn the dynamics of the agent which are then fused into the optimization procedure.'
