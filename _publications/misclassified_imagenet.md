excerpt: 'In supervised image-classification, the richness of ImageNet dataset imposes difficulties for researchers to visually find any useful patterns of misclassification of deep neural networks. We propose "Superclassing ImageNet dataset". By training neural networks on this dataset, we found that: (i) Misclassifications are rarely across superclasses, but mainly among subclasses within a superclass. (ii) Ensemble networks trained each only on subclasses of a given superclass perform better than the same network trained on all subclasses of all superclasses.'
