excerpt: 'Understanding the patterns of misclassified ImageNet images is particularly important, as it could guide us to design deep neural networks (DNN) that generalize better. However, the richness of ImageNet imposes difficulties for researchers to visually find any useful patterns of misclassification. Here, to help find these patterns, we propose "Superclassing ImageNet dataset". It is a subset of ImageNet which consists of 10 superclasses, each containing 7-116 related subclasses (e.g., 52 bird types, 116 dog types). By training neural networks on this dataset, we found that: (i) Misclassifications are rarely across superclasses, but mainly among subclasses within a superclass.'
