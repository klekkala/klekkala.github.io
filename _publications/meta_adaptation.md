excerpt: 'In real-world imitation learning, where the trajectory distribution of most of the tasks dynamically shifts, model fitting on continuously aggregated data alone would be futile. We show experiments where the agent is trained from a diversity of environmental tasks and is also able to adapt to an unseen environment, using few-shot learning.'
