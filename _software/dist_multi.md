excerpt: 'API which allows distributed training for multi task learning. Usually multi task learning is done on a single machine/GPU, especially due to the networks having small footprints. But in the case networks tend to be larger, especially in computer vision where the memory consumption of bottleneck/feature extractor networks, along with the individual task specific heads tend to be higher. In these scinarios, we could have divide the entire model on different machines.'
