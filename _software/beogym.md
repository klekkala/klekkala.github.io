excerpt: 'Beogym is a gym environment for training RL agents to perform high level navigation. To use this API, you need a dataset of panaromic images and the GPS coordinates associated with them. Although this is primarily designed for USC ILab 3D dataset, you can plug in any outdoor dataset which have the necassary attributes. This API also has added functionality of integrating CarlaEnv which is an API for training RL agents to navigate in CARLA simulator.'
