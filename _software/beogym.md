excerpt: 'Gym environment for training RL agents to perform high-level navigation. Although this API is primarily designed for [USC-ILab 3D dataset](https://klekkala.github.io/datasets/usc_ilab3d), you can plug in any dataset containing GPS annoted panaromas. This API also has added functionality accessing data from CARLA simulator which can aid in Sim2Real transfer.'
