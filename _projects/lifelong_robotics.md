excerpt: 'Lifelong Learning (LL) is a relatively new area of machine learning (ML) research, in which agents continually learn as they encounter varying conditions and tasks while deployed in the field, acquiring experience and knowledge and improving performance on both novel and previous tasks1. This differs from the train-then-deploy process for typical ML systems, which often results in (1) unpredictable outcomes when input conditions not representative of training experiences are encountered, (2) catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge useful for new instances of previously learned tasks, and (3) the inability to execute new tasks effectively.'
