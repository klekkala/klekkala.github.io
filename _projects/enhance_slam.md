excerpt: 'In recent years, flying robots such as autonomous quadcopters have gained increased interest in robotics and computer vision research. For navigating safely, these robots need the ability to localize themselves autonomously using their onboard sensors. Potential applications of such systems include the automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings, inspection and simple maintenance tasks, surveillance of public places as well as in search and rescue systems. In this project, I am trying to study and apply the current techniques for 3D localization, mapping and navigation that are suitable for quadcopters and try to come up with newer and better algorithms than the existing ones.'
