excerpt: 'A ROS-Gazebo based simulator for large-scale mobile-manipulation tasks using a simulated version of [BeoBot](https://klekkala.github.io/hardware/). Currently, we are exploring ways on how to deploy models that have been trained on a life-long learning setting and deploy on a mobile manipulator. The entire setup of the real-world mobile was  custom built in our lab.'
