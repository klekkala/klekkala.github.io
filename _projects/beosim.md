excerpt: 'Recently, we also started BeoSim, a Gazebo based simulator for large-scale mobile-manipulation tasks using a simulated version of Beobot. Currently, we are exploring ways on how to deploy models that have been trained on a life-long learning setting and deploy on a mobile manipulator which involves a simulated version of BeoArm learning a task, for example, how to push a block. We have the entire setup of the mobile manipulator in the simulator, which is real world mobile manipulator custom built in our lab. The entire system also has a working ROS based simulation'
