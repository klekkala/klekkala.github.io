excerpt: 'We study existing works on Entity segmentation, Multi-Entity VAE and video prediction and hypothesize a new algorithm which could be used for multi-entity tracking and representation learning which thereby, could improve scene representation and prediction. Apart from trying to improve each of these subdomains, we also formulate how each of them could be connected to better state representation learning.'
