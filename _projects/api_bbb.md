excerpt: 'This project was done as part of [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), and consists of easy­ to ­use APIs for the hardware on the ​Beaglebone Blue. These APIs were rewritten from the original Strawson APIs for the Strawson Robotics Cape which used the Cape hardware by the userspace drivers and mmap. On the other hand, Beaglebone Blue APIs uses kernel-API approach to use the Beaglebone Blue hardware.'
