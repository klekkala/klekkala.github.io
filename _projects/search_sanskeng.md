excerpt: 'We are implementing a search-engine system for lectures containing sanskrit and english. The search engine is based on transformer models, which are trained on a large corpus of transcripts obtained from the audio lectures. These transcripts are first transcribed using [otter.ai](otter.ai), but are further processed and filtered using a few of our custom algorithms.'
